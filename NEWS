pyvle 1.0.2
===========

- Fix default return on listDynamicObservables: If dynamic is not
  found, there was no return statement, which leads to a seg fault.

- Add function listViewEntries: This function associates the list of
  complete names of ports to the view names; ie. it gives column names
  for all views (Closes #3475367).

- Fix location of module cache clear: When we clear the module cache,
  plugins attached to modules should be deleted first. On simulation
  error whith simple runs, errors are now communicated on python
  prompt. (Closes: #3313030).

- Add all vle value types management: All value types can be converted
  from python to vle and vice versa. Specific python classes vleXML,
  vleTUPLE, vleTABLE, vleMATRIX that embed classical python structures
  are added in order to remove ambiguity in conversion form python to
  vle.  (Closes: #3474408, #3474406).
